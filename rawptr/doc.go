// Package rawptr is an unsafe pointer utility package.
//
// This package is meant to make common unsafe pointer tasks easier and
// require fewer intermediate variables or casts. It does not change the
// rules or semantics around a regular unsafe.Pointer, so one should still
// be cautious when using this package.
